# Telecommunication
Using Octave
Hello, it's Jabbinha here, in this repository I'll put some codes that I'm using on my course of Telecommunication.
This time the professor let us use Simulink from Matlab, but I just have this on the university, so I'm using sometimes Simulink, and another times I'm programing on GNU Octave.
The Lab 04 I was trying to create an AM-DSB Modulation and Demodulation. I included a block diagram and a code.m that was ables to do this.
